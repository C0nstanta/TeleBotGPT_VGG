GPT3 Model:
Options:

max_length - Maximum number of tokens, which the model remembers.
The recommended parameter is 256. The maximum is 512. If there is more, it will be 512. (not done yet)

no_repeat_ngram_size - Penalizes for the number of repetitions.

do_sample - The value can be 0 or 1.

If we enable - set 1, then we automatically disable the top_p and top_k parameters.
If we have 1, we start choosing from the generated words, the next word based on conditional probability.
Increases the likelihood of words that suit us better.

top_k - The number of words from which then the one that suits us will be selected.

top_p - Same as top_k - only in% (from 0 to 1)
The more% - the fewer words will participate in the further selection to find the desired word.

temperature - A value from 0 to 3 (If more, it will be 3).
As Mikhail Konstantinov says - "Temperature is how your model hallucinates."

0 - The model is completely adequate and boring.
3 - delirium - delirium.

num_return_sequences - Number of generated return sentences, among which the modeler will then select suitable offer.

device - 0 - the model is running on the CPU. 1 - the model is GPU-powered.
We only have a CPU. There are not many options (

is_always_use_length - The value can be 0 or 1. If we choose 0, it is generated
answer of any length.

length_generate - The length of the sentences generated by the bot.
1 - Short answer.
2 - Average answer.
3 - Long answer.
